        <p>Web app for people who wants to invest on the real
          estate market to rent their properties for others.
          The app targets to seasonal users who’s eager to invest
          in properties, so they need a tool that easily walk them
          through the enitre process of finding and renting at the
          real estate market getting comprehensive information
          on the property and its neightbourhood before visiting
          the place. For that reason the app had be powerful and
          complex, yet simple, clean and handy.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the users</h3>
        <p>Basing on research and a persona’s profile, I found
          patterns in the users’ needs, goals and challenges.</p>

        <h3>User flows</h3>
        <p>Users were the people usually on-the-go, so mobile experience
          was crutial for them. While designing their flows, I wanted to
          limit their effort to a minimum and have them achive their goals
          within as little amount of steps as possible..</p>

        <h3>Mid-fidelity wireframes</h3>
        <p>Another itereation made it clear that the user’s flow needed to be
          simplified in both visual hierarchy and navigation. Among other
          things, I applied a Tabbed Control menu instead of long screens of
          swiping. That way, users could fully control were they were and
          switch between screens easily.</p>

        <h3>Usability testss</h3>
        <p>I conducted a test with users. The results came with another
          improvements including onboarding process among others.
          Now, the user was able to have a glimpse of the app’s possibilities
          by simply swiping up the welcome screen before signing up or
          logging in. Also, I redesigned the subnavigation to make it less
          prominent than the main menu, and I moved an icon for search
          filters up, next to the search bar. With all of that, users’
          experience became clean and handy.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <p>The app solved main problems of people who want to invest in real estate,
          like a little knowledge they have in this field. In the future,
          the app could open to people who look for houses and flats to live there.
          Therefor the app could be a place where both groups meet.</p>
